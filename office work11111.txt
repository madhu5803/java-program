Unit tests are useful at all levels of programming.




What are unit test frameworks and how are they used? Simply stated, 
they are software tools to support writing and running unit tests, 
including a foundation on which to build tests and the functionality to execute the tests and report their results

Unit test frameworks can contribute to almost every stage of software development, 
including software architecture and design, code implementation and debugging, performance optimization, and quality assurance.


TESTNG:-

TestNG is also a Java-based unit testing framework. NG stands for 'Next Generation'.

It processes Unit tests with passing parameters into the test methods.
Making use of Threads enhances testing performance better as execution time is reduced


TestNG provides parallel execution of test methods. It allows to define dependency of one test method over other method



TestNG Parameters are the arguments that we pass to the test methods. 

TestNG Parameters. TestNG DataProviders.


GTEST:-

Google Test (also known as gtest) is a unit testing library for the C++ programming language, based on the xUnit architecture.





Unit testing ensures that all code meets quality standards before it's deployed.


This framework is specifically designed for Java programming language.
 In this, data is first tested and then it is inserted in the piece of code


EMMA:  EMMA is an open-source toolkit for analyzing and reporting code written in Java language.
Emma support coverage types like method, line, basic block. It is Java-based so it is without external library dependencies and can access the source code.
